Contributions are submitted via pull requests on GitHub.
A pull request is reviewed by someone who is a member of the "osdev-wiki"
organization ("reviewers") and that therefore has the permission to merge it.
Reviewers must make sure that following things hold before merging a pull
request:

. The pull request complies with the content guidelines.
  In particular, the reviewer must make sure that the commit messages are
  compliant.
  In addition, the reviewer must check the contribution for plagiarism.

. The contribution is within the scope of the wiki.
  In particular, reviewers may make discretionary decisions on whether a
  contribution is accepted or rejected.

. The contribution was not submitted or authored in part by the reviewer
  reviewing the contribution.

Multiple reviewers may review the same pull request.
Diagreements between reviewers may be mediated or resolved by another member of
the "osdev-wiki" organization who is uninvolved in the dispute.
If no such mediation is possible, the dispute is resolved through general
consensus among the members of the "osdev-wiki" organization.
If there is no conseus, the _status quo_ remains.
